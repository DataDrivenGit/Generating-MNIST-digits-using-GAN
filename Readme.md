In this project, I have created a MNNIST digit generator model. where generator is trained to create image of MNIST digits. 

#### What are GANS? 
Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are an exciting recent innovation in machine learning. GANs are generative models: they create new data instances that resemble your training data. For example, GANs can create images that look like photographs of human faces, even though the faces don't belong to any real person. These images were created by a GAN:

#### how it works ?
GANs achieve this level of realism by pairing a generator, which learns to produce the target output, with a discriminator, which learns to distinguish true data from the output of the generator. The generator tries to fool the discriminator, and the discriminator tries to keep from being fooled.

Obtained results after 8600 and 9800 epochs are shown below:
